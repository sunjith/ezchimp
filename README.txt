Notes:
-----
We understand the importance of open source especially for a third party module going into a billing
system. We have nothing to hide and decided to open source ezchimp. You are free to go through the code,
make corrections or enhancements and share it back. Or maybe this will help someone as a reference to
build another similar WHMCS module or MailChimp integration for another software like WHMCS.

Please send your fixes, updates, modifications (as patch if possible), suggestions and ideas to ezchimp@admod.com
to be included in the distribution so that everyone can benefit from it. And it would be easy for you to
follow ezchimp updates as you won't have to apply your modifications to each later release of ezchimp.
Also we shall include your name and domain/page (if any) in CREDITS section below.
